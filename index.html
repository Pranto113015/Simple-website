<p>E-mail means electronic mail. It is a great achievement of modern science. It is an important system in modern communication. People are very much interested to know about e-mail because e-mail is cheaper than any other system of communication. It is very much helpful for the students. Students require consulting many books or research papers. But all are not available in their nearst library or in any library in bangladesh. But e-mail offers the students the great opportunity to collect any information from any book via internet. Students can have access to the e-mail and can have their required information. It is very cheap and easy to avail. Besides, using e-mail one can save their time. If a student has a personal computer, he can set e-mail communication. So e-mail saves money as well as time. It also reduces the consumption of paper. So in all these respects e-mail is very useful for the students in Bangladesh. Every student should have e-mail facilities.</p>
